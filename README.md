# undeadwolf-site
my website made with php

You can veiw the website locally by running the php -S Localhost:8000 in the direcorty 

you may be able to access site online at https://my-site.undeadwolf.repl.co/index.php if its still running on replit however i only use replit if im coding remotly so it may be newer or out of date 

alternatively a simplified version of the site from the neocities branch will be veiwable at https://undeadwolf.neocities.org/
its simplified due to the lack of php support on neocities
